# Code_Examples

I created this repo to showcase some of the work I've done for other companies, if part of the hiring process or part of the work itself. 
The purpose here is to give you a flavor of the different skills I use to be successful in my work as a data scientist in the healthcare domain. 
Some code snippets are more technical, some more mathematical and some present a combination of knowledge domain and data science skills. 
I have taken the proprietary part out of the code. Therefore, if you actually want to run some of these code snippets I might need to do further adjustments to the code.

For example, codes like:
                    1. Data_transfom_assinemnt_RNM.ipynb
                    2. Upload_Data.ipynb
                    3. HarmonizedT-input-Final.ipynb
                
were written and executed on an AWS analytics platform called DNAnexuos (https://www.dnanexus.com/).


Other files are:
_______________

Games_DS_homework_test.ipynb - shows a couple of python tasks that demonstrate math and modeling in Python.

Main_example.ipynb depends on Connect_Azure_Blob.ipynb and Tokens.ipynb - this is more a data eng code demonstrating a way to connect to Azure storage and load / dump files.

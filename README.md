# Code_Examples

I created this repo to showcase some of the work I've done for other companies, if part of the hiring process or part of the work itself. 
The purpose here is to gibe you a flaiovour of the different skiils I use to be sucessful in my work as a data scietist in the healthcare domian. 
Some code snippets are more technical, some more mathematical and some present a combination of knowledge domai and data sciens skills. 
I have taken the priopetery part out of the code. Therefore, if you actuacly want to run some of these code snippedt I might need to do further ajudtments to the code.

For example, codes like:
                    1. Data_transfom_assinemnt_RNM.ipynb
                    2. Upload_Data.ipynb
                    
                    were written and executed on an AWS analytics platform called DNAnexuos (https://www.dnanexus.com/).
